# botAlpha
Chatbot to perform arithtmetic, movie search, and idle chat.

Steps to use:
(1) Run plot_relations to get a Doc2Vec model.
(2) Train the RASA model to get chatbot model in models subdirectory.
(3) Run RASA shell and RASA action server to test the model.

May have to create a virtual environment to avoid dependancy clashes.
